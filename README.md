# Shatter Silence

A SOW initiave project to provide a platform for everyone who wants to speak their voices out or want legal advice in various situations. Using this platform we want to enourage the oppressed around the world, to come forward and speak. We want you to know you are not alone in this, we can fight this. Before reaching the other side of this, it is important that you take the first step, and shatter the silence.

This is also a place for people with knowldege of constitution to give back to the society.
